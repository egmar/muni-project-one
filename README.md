# Project One

## Summary

In this project I will show through several steps how to create a Node.JS application which leverages IBM Cloud Services. 
Application will act as bot which can be enable on one or more Github repositories. Specifically, application (further bot) 
will have following functionality:
 - Develop an application Github Apps paradigm, using [Probot framework](https://probot.github.io/)
 - Add IBM Cloud specific metadata
 - Register IBM Watson Text Analysis service
 - Register for Github issues and pull requests notifications
 - Use tone analysis service API to analyse issue and comments and up-vote or down-vote based on tone
 - Run application locally for development purposes
 - Deploy application in IBM Cloud
